      [spamsch]

      [spamsch]

0.4.7 (01.10.2007)

    - Added schema template editor - allows defining re-usable schemata. 
      [mkoch,ctheune]

0.4.6 (never released)

    - Fixed #12: isEmpty always shown als activated validator.
      [spamsch]

      Alexander Pilz for finding this.
      [spamsch]

    - supplied missing import: this fixes #9 Broken uninstall method
      [lzdych]

0.4.6rc1 (17.08.2007)

    - Started writing some simple howto (doc/HOWTO.txt)
      [spamsch]

    - Added new feature flag HAS_MANAGEMENT_UI_FUNCTIONALITY that
      can be used to control if management functions are displayed.
      [spamsch]

    - UI p0rn (much more to come)
      [spamsch]

    - Fixed bug where a security check did not success for TTW added
      schemas. Thanks to Hedley Roos.
      [spamsch]

    - Added a patch for Products.validation.RangeValidator to relax the
      max value check (instead of value < maxval we check value <= maxval)
      and added there tolerance to string typed max and min.
      [spamsch]

    - Extended editor so that you can pass your own parameters to each
      validator that supports parameters (like inNumericRange). Also
      added a bridge to non-registered RegexValidator so that users
      can input their own regular expression.
      [spamsch]

    - Extended editor so that you can now upload a file to each field.
      Usecase: Fields based upon editor defined fields want to have a
      template.

      Example:

        atse_config.field_registry.update({'ExcelField': {'field': ExcelField, 
                                                 'allowed_widgets':['ExcelWidget', 'FileWidget', ],
                                                 'post_method':'atse_attachFilePostMethod',
                                                 'post_macro':'here/fileattach_macros/macros/upload'}})

      Simply define post_method and post_macro as defined here. For this
      example an excel file can be uploaded to excel fields and serve as template.
      You can then access the attached file: schemaeditor.atse_getAttachedFieldFile(<fieldname>).
      [spamsch]

    - Revamped validator selection so that it shows a list of available
      validators instead of having the user input them.
      [spamsch]

    - Added support for ATVocabularyManager including UI selection of vocabularies.
      [spamsch]

    - Introduced new flag HAS_FIELD_VISIBILITY_ENABLED that controls
      if the UI should show the visibility controls for a field.
      [spamsch]

    - Introduced a new flag HAS_SECURITY_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED that controls
      if the UI shows field security management related stuff.
      [spamsch]

    - Introduced new method atse_hasFeature(name) that can be used to
      check if a given feature (defined in config.py) is available.
      [spamsch]

    - Fixed field->widget associations defined in config.py. The complete
      select line (like Flex or Radio) were not included.
      [spamsch]

    - Added methode atse_reinitializeRegistries because upon fresh registration
      of fields and widgets instances do not get the changes.
      [spamsch]

    - documentation updates - clarify maintainership and add contributions
      [spamsch]

0.4.5 (never released)

    - Fixed uninstall procedure - CMFQI does not remove configlets
      Thanks to IOhannes m zmoelnig for the fix.
      [spamsch]

    - Added permission handling for fields. For each field you can
      now select the permission from an predefined list 
      (from site_properties/atsePossible*Permissions)
      [spamsch]

    - Added some constraints for allowed widgets. Look at config.py
      to see what changed (allowed_widgets). For each field we now
      define a set of acceptable widgets. Now you can't select an IntWidget
      for a ReferenceField anymore :-)
      [spamsch]

    - Added type support for DataGridField. That means that you can specify a types
      for each of the fields you define. Needs patched version of DataGridField!
      Please make sure to apply the included diff (in doc/datagridfield-validatecolumn.diff)
      to a 1.5.0 version of DataGridField (MoreFieldsAndWidgets/DataGridField/tags/1.5.0).
      If you don't do this ATSE will not include DataGridFieldSupport!

      Do the following to patch correctly:
      $ cd <path_to_DataGridField>
      $ cat version.txt
      1.5.0
      $ patch -p 0 < ../ATSchemaEditorNG/doc/datagridfield-validatedcolumn.diff
      [spamsch]

0.4.4 (18.04.2007)

    - Fixed DataGridWidget failure
      [spamsch]

    - Fixed references to zLOG replacing with logging package
      [spamsch]

    - added MultiCheckbox widget - defined as MultiSelectionWidget(format="checkbox")
      [naro]

    - added vocabulary proxy method and option to use python scripts as vocabulary source.
      Additionaly to key|value and method:methodname as vocabulary source, there can be 
      'script:' (without script name). Script name is computed automaticaly as
      atse_<portal type>_<fieldname>Vocabulary. 

      Example:: 

          Portal type: 'Target 1', field countryType::

          atse_Target1_countryTypeVocabulary - this is name of the python script or external method 
          [naro]
  
    
    - portal_status_message is encoded to utf8 before sent to browser.
      Plone 2.5 returns translated strings in unicode.
      [naro]

    - made use of FD in atse_update consistent. Now you can
      always use dictionaries.
      [spamsch]

    - added one more test that uses atse_update to create field
      [spamsch]

0.4.3 (10.10.2006)

    - more tests for portal_factory madness
      [spamsch]

    - fixed DataGridField templates related to atseng: schema editor template
      was broken after DataGridField was selected as field type
      [lzdych]

    - ATSE tool is no longer implicitly available
      [spamsch]

    - fixed broken schema editor template after new schema is created
      [lzdych]

    - Added one more check for portal_factory types. Could not model
      a test for parent of a folder being TempFolder when using
      PortalFactory but it seems that it fixes some errors on other
      instances and has no impact on running ones 
      [spamsch]

0.4.2 (27.06.2006)

    - disabled automatic creation of backup file. This configuration
      is done over property atseAutomaticBackupWhenUpdateSchema in
      site_properties. If users want to have automatic backup
      then this property needs to be enabled.
      [spamsch]

    - disabled installation of example types in config.py
      If types should be installed then enable property in config.py
      [spamsch]

    - some bugfixes to make ParentManagedSchema play nicely with
      portal_factory managed types. Bug reported by Aaron VanDerlip
      [spamsch]

    - added support for DataGridField/Widget (if DG is available)
      Please read doc/DATAGRID.txt
      [naro]

    - fixed minor bug in ReferenceField/Widget handling
      [naro]

0.4.1 (08.06.2006)

      not longer automatically update schema from Editor since
      0.4. Added extensive documentation about this change.
      [spamsch]

        - Fixes for schema syncing - Schemas are now never synced w/o explicit user action
        - Added dynamic object registering support
        - Added role based field permission settings
          [spamsch]

    - reworked some of the template stuff to make dynamic registration of types possible

0.3.3 (02.04.2006)

   - added support for ImageField max_size and sizes properties

     rendering schema editor

   - handle the absence of a default schema gracefully by displaying a
     message instead of raising an exception

     and 'checkbox_bound'.

   - allow setting 'startup_directory' for ReferenceBrowserWidget.

     initialization, if necessary.

   - added special edit accessor for ReferenceFields

   - schema selector bug fix

0.3.1 (unreleased)

   - added support for sync'ing unmanaged and new fields from the
     source code, to bring cached ATSE schemas into sync w/ any

     convert the _obj_ptype attribute from a list to an OOBTree

   - added field, widget, and storage registry functionality
