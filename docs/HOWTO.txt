If you are new to ATSchemaEditorNG then this document is the right one for you.
This document is currently under development. Feel free to send suggestions to
the maintainer.

Main purpose of ATSE: You want to let users manage schemas TTW w/o ever
touching any code on the filesystem. 

One quick example could be the management of address records. You have two
content types where the first is a folderish one that contains address record
objects holding details like full name and phone. 

Now your customer wants these fields to be manageable by himself because there
is often the need to add new fields (e.g. record has email field but another
email must be recorded) or even delete ones. Your customer also needs full
control over the rights management because security assertions for fields
change over time. Ok you say - we have ATSE and we'll give you full control. 

Fire up your editor and lets create the folderish type that'll hold all
address records:

class AddressContainer(BaseFolder, SchemaEditor):

    meta_type = portal_type = 'AddressContainer'
    archetype_name = 'AddressContainer'
    allowed_content_types = ('Address', )

** more to come **
