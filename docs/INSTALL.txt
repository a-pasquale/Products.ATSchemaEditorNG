ATSE will install a tool that will be used for ToolManagedSchemas.
For demo types enable them in config.py. Then install a container, some
types (Target1-3) and try to change some fields.

Make sure to have a look at the new properties in site_properties.

Also make sure you read the notice in README.txt concerning changes
since version 0.4

If you are using DataGridField:

    ATSE needs patched version of DataGridField!

    Please make sure to apply the included diff (in doc/datagridfield-validatecolumn.diff)
    to a 1.5.0 version of DataGridField (MoreFieldsAndWidgets/DataGridField/tags/1.5.0).
    If you don't do this ATSE will not include DataGridFieldSupport!

    Do the following to patch correctly:
    $ cd <path_to_DataGridField>
    $ cat version.txt
    1.5.0
    $ patch -p 0 < ../ATSchemaEditorNG/doc/datagridfield-validatedcolumn.diff
